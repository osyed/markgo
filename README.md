# markgo

An easier way to move between directories.

When you are in a directory that you want to return to in the future; mark it with a label:
* cd some/long/dir/path
* mark x

When you want to return to a directory you have previously marked:
* cd
* go x

To see all the marks and the corresponding directory:
* showmark

To delete a mark:
* unmark x
